            <strong>'Your mother is always with you</strong>,she's the <em>whisper</em> of the leaves<br>
            as you walk down the street,she's the <em>smell</em> of certain foods you remmember,<br>
            flower's you pick, the fragrance of <em>life</em> itself,she's the <em>cool</em> hand<br>
            on your brow when you're not feeling well,she's your <em>breath</em> in the air on a<br>
            cold winter's day, she's the <em>sound</em> of the rain that lulls you to sleep, the<br>
            colors of the rainbow,<strong>your mother lives inside your laughter</strong>.<br>
            she's the <em>place</em> you come from,your first home,and she's the <em>map</em> you <br>
            follow with every step you take,<strong>she's your first <em>love</em>,and your first <em>friend</em>.</strong>
